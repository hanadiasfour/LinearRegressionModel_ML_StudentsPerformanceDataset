    " - The model **is slightly overfits** the data. This is because the error metrics values are lower in the trainning data, and the R^2 values is higher in compare to the testing data. This means the model performs well on the training data, but finds it harder to generalize its abilities to unseen test data. But in general, the model performed very well and there were no significant differences, therefore, the overral evaluation of the model is just slightly overfit.\n",
